# Prerequisites

In order to start using DynamiteNSM, you must install `Python`. 
We currently support all versions of `Python 2.7.1+`, but recommend `Python 3.6+` for the most stable experience.

DynamiteNSM runs exclusively on Linux and is currently compatible with a handful of Red Hat and Debian based distributions.

Before Going any further, ensure that you are running on a supported [operating system](../../introduction/supported_operating_systems).

## Pre-flight check
1. Check to see your [operating system](../../introduction/supported_operating_systems) is supported.
2. Ensure you have at least `Python 2.7.1` installed (We recommend `3.6+`).
3. Ensure you have the corresponding version of [pip](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_pip.asp) installed.
