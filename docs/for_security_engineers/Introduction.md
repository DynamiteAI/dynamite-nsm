## Welcome to the Security Engineer Documentation.

This documentation is targeted to those who want to immediately begin monitoring their network with DynamiteNSM. 
We'll cover a variety of deployment scenarios and discuss best practices and troubleshooting techniques.

### Small Network / Lab Environment

Setup DynamiteNSM agent and monitoring services on the same hardware. We'll walk you through deploying on a very small 
network.

Setup DynamiteNSM to monitor traffic within a relatively small network environment (less than 100 Endpoints). 
In this scenario we'll install DynamiteNSM services across multiple instances.
