# Overview

**By default**, DynamiteNSM ships with a powerful analytics package containing dashboards and visualizations, purpose built for a variety 
of operational and detection use-cases. 


## Modules

Within the `BaseViews` Kibana package, `modules` designate a collection of views built around a specific sub-set of filters.

These filters slice Dynamite's [ECS based](/about/data_model/01_overview) data into four categories: alerts, events, hosts, and protocols. 

Each module provides a unique perspective into one of these categories. To view a specific module, click the module name in the left pane of the view.  Module views are structured in a standard way, you'll find links to additional views at the very top of the page, directly below the view title.  Below that you'll find a histogram showing the volume of relevent events over time.  This histogram is interactive and can be used - by clicking and dragging - to further refine the timerange filter.  Further down the page, you'll find visualizations that illuminate the porportions of different categorical values in the data set.  These visualizations are also interactive, and by clicking on a value you can quickly include or exclude the value from the filter in use by the view.  Finally, at the bottom of the view, you'll find the data table which provides access to the raw events.  After you've explored the view's visualizations, use the data table for more detailed analysis and to access pivots to other relevant views.  

### Alerts

Alerts are typically indicative of suspicious or malicious behavior. The Alerts module provides different perspectives that make investigating this suspicious traffic, simple and efficient.  The histogram at the top of the main alerts view provides a breakdown of alert volume by category.  Click on the category name in the legend to exclude/include the category from the visualization.  Click and select the time range to dial-in the time range filter to exactly the window of activity you're interested in.  The categorical visualizations provide different vantage points into notable alert attributes.  Click on a value in the legend to add/remove specific values from the view filter.    

> ⓘ You can always [adjust](/configuration/agent/03_scripts_and_rules#suricata) the kinds of alerts that get triggered through the dynamite commandline utility.

#### Alert Map

The `Alert Map` view provides a world map showing the volume of alerts (represented as a color) generated by countries around the world.  Alerts shown in this view originated externally, that is outside of the monitored network environment.  While exploring the world map, click on a particular country to add it to the view filter.  The list of alerts shown in the data table will be updated allowing you to quickly triage the alerts source from the selected country.  

#### Discovery View

The `Discovery View` in the Alerts module provides a list of raw alerts in a customized data table.  This view provides an easy-to-digest list of alerts that can be filtered and explored using the search bar.  Most commonly, the discovery view is used when you want to search for alerts of a particular type or to/from a particular host.  This view is also good for refining queries and filters and turning them into custom visualizations.   

### Conversations

Conversations represent a bi-directional communications between hosts. 
In addition to conversations this view provides high-level summaries of top-talkers, ports, and application
protocols.

### Hosts

The host views focus on providing metrics from the perspective of internal and external hosts on and off the network.

### Protocols

Protocols in this module refer primarily to application layer protocols. 
This view primarily functions as a launch point into protocol specific views.

> ⓘ You can always [adjust](/configuration/agent/03_scripts_and_rules#zeek) the kinds of protocols that get analyzed through the dynamite commandline utility.
