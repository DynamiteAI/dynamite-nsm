## Welcome to the Data Scientist Documentation

This documentation is intended for those who really want to dig deep into the data produced by the DynamiteNSM agent. 

Our stack is built upon Elasticsearch (OpenDistro 1.13.0) and normalizes all events to [ECS 1.5](/guides/for_security_analysts/event_format), leading to easily accessible and relatively homogeneous data-sets.

We have several projects in the works to make our stack more accessible to data-scientists *and will be open-sourcing these soon* to encourage collaboration!
