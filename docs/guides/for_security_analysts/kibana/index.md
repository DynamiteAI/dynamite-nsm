## Description

Kibana is a powerful tool for visualizing data stored within Elasticsearch. DynamiteNSM has been redesigned to work on top of the
[OpenSearch stack](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch/), a fully open-source derivative of the ElasticStack.


## Packages

DynamiteNSM 1.0 introduces the concept of Kibana packages. Packages contain things like dashboards, visualizations, 
saved searches and index patterns and can easily be installed uninstalled through the `dynamite` commandline utility.
