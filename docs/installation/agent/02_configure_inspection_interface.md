## Inspection Interface(s)

Inspection interfaces receive traffic from a [SPAN port or TAP device](../../../requirements/04_span_vs_tap). Typically, they do not need IP addresses.

> â“˜ A notable exception is on AWS's [port-mirroring implementation for VPCs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/mirroring/what-is-traffic-mirroring.html) which relies on VXLAN 
> encapsulation requiring the monitored interface to have a routable ip address.

Disabling any NIC offloading functions such as `tso`, `gso`, and `gro` can also improve performance.
