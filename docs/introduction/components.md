### The Agent


The agent (sensor) is responsible for generating JSON events from raw network packets and forwarding these events to a monitor.

### The Monitor

The monitor is responsible for collecting these events, enriching and normalizing them, and presenting them to the end-user through intuitive visualizations and a powerful search user interface.
