# Contribute to a DynamiteNSM

## Getting Started

You do not need to be a developer to contribute to this project. DynamiteNSM is relatively modular in design
and offers quite a few places to plug in.

## Dynamite Projects

DynamiteNSM consists of several projects that are independent of one another.

## Types of Contribution

1. Discussions are where we have conversations. 
   If you'd like help troubleshooting a docs PR you're working on, 
   have a great new idea, or want to share something amazing you've learned in our docs, join us in [discussions](https://github.com/DynamiteAI/dynamite-nsm/discussions).
   
2. [Issues](https://github.com/DynamiteAI/dynamite-nsm/issues) are used to track tasks that contributors can help with. We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

3. A pull request is a way to suggest changes in our repository. 
   When one is made, a member of our team will `accept`, `reject` or most often `request changes` before it is scheduled 
   for a future release. Before going any further please check out our [developer guide](/guides/developers/01_overview) to better understand the areas we 
   are receiving pull requests in.
