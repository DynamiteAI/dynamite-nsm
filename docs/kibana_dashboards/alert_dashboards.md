The alert module compliments the event module by drawing attention to events that may be indicative of malicious behavior. The core dashboards here are the alert and threat dashboards.

- The alert dashboard provides a general overview of alerts organized by criticality.
- The threat dashboard provides a similar view but organizes alerts by:
  - Public attacker IPs
  - Detection Signatures
  - IP Reputations
  - Known Vulnerabilities (CVEs)

This module also provides a collection of dashboards for application protocol specific alerting.
