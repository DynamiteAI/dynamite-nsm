# Files Dashboards

![Files Dashboards](../img/dashboards/files-dashboard.png)

The files dashboards make direct use of Zeek's files framework. These dashboards show relationships between source and destination hosts and any files sent over relevant protocols.

The framework currently has the ability to extract files from:

- FTP
- HTTP
- SMB
- SMTP
- SSL
