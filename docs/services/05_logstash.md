# Logstash
Logstash is an open-source server-side data processing pipeline that allows you to collect data from a variety of sources, 
transform it on the fly, and send it to your desired destination.

> â“˜ Logstash is an optional component within the Dynamite stack and is not installed as part of the `monitor`.
> DynamiteNSM does not currently provide an automated integration strategy with Logstash. 
> 
> Once installed, Logstash must be manually configured to listen for events from the `agent`, forwarding them downstream
> to a collector of your choice.



DynamiteNSM pre-configures Logstash with several useful defaults, and automatically optimizes its use of the JVM heap.

$ sudo dynamite logstash -h
