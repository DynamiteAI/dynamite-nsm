# Project Goals

Passive network monitoring is an approach to network monitoring where traffic is *sniffed* via
strategically placed sensors on critical junctions of a network. DynamiteNSM aims to make the process of setting up
and managing this infrastructure as seamless as possible.

## Simple
Keep interfaces simple and intuitive. Users should be able to get to a working state with minimal documentation.

## Lightweight 

Give users the option to install and configure only the components they need 
without requiring them to download a huge image.

## Extensible

Provide intuitive programming interfaces and utilities where ever possible, giving users multiple paths of integration and extension.

## Adaptable

Provide variety of ways users can interact with their data, ranging from tracking operational network metrics to threat-hunting.


## Secure

Install components pre-configured with security in mind. Wherever possible encrypt data in transit and at rest.

## Optimized

Install components to best utilize system resources. When needed, make changes to the underlying system to improve tasks like
packet acquisition and memory management.


## Centralized

Provide users with the tools needed to remotely manage their deployments. Users should be able to perform remote operations against multiple instances in parallel. Users should be able 
to copy the configuration state of one node to another.
