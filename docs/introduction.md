# Introduction

Passive network monitoring is an approach to network monitoring that tracks actual traffic over time using sensors or built-in data capture capabilities on switches and other network devices. In this scenario a network operator will simply deploy sensors on critical junctions on the network, such as a core switch. The sensor will rely on either port mirroring, or where higher throughput is expected a dedicated TAP device. The design of network sensors varies, but most can provide a high-level representation of network data which can be ingested in some normalized format for downstream processing. The success of a passive network monitor depends largely on three criteria:
- The deployment of sensors throughout your environment
- The process by which data is normalized between sensors
- The insights generated by the aggregation of sensor data

Our team built our technology stack on several enterprise-grade technologies that allow network operators to answer a variety of questions. 

Foremost among these technologies are Zeek and Suricata. 

Zeek is an extremely powerful protocol analyzer, that can provide detailed enough protocol metadata to replace the need for full packet-capture solutions.
Suricata is a rule based intrusion detection system, that can find malicious activity in a sea of network traffic.
Both of these tools, while extremely powerful are difficult to deploy maintain and scale. In addition, neither provides out-of-the-box data retention or visualisation resources.

Our team built DynamiteNSM in order to make network monitoring as painless as possible and to provide users with powerful insights into their networks.
