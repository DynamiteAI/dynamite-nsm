### What is Dynamite Network Security Monitor?

DynamiteNSM is a lightweight, versatile network security monitor designed to make securing your network environment simple and intuitive.

It has two main components: agent and monitor. Dynamite agents can easily be deployed to monitor dedicated network segments while the monitor provides a powerful query interface and in-depth analytics.

**To get started. Simply install via PIP on a supported [operating system](https://dynamiteai.github.io/dynamite-nsm/requirements/01_supported_operating_systems):**

```
sudo pip3 install dynamite-nsm
```

### Agent
***The agent (sensor) is responsible for generating JSON events from raw network data acquired off the wire as well as parsing out relevant information, and forwarding these events to a monitor or third-party data-store.***

**To install on your sensor hardware (or VM):**
```
sudo dynamite agent install --inspect-interfaces=<iface1> <iface2> <iface3>
```


### Monitor 

***The monitor collects events/alerts generated by the agent quickly indexing them and presenting them within intuitive visualizations and powerful query interfaces.***

**To install on your monitor hardware (or VM):**
```
sudo dynamite monitor install
```
