</p>

***The agent (sensor) is responsible for generating JSON events from raw network data acquired off the wire as well as parsing out relevant information, and forwarding these events to a monitor or third-party data-store.***

**To install on your sensor hardware (or VM):**
```
sudo dynamite agent install --inspect-interfaces=<iface1> <iface2> <iface3>
```
