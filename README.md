### Getting Started

While there are quite a few components that are a part of Dynamite-NSM. Standing up a standalone agent/monitor deployment is very simple.

#### Monitor (Standalone all components installed)

##### Specs
```
Linux Kernel: 2.6.32+
16 GB of RAM at least 4 CPU
```
##### Setup

Install the monitoring components all on the same machine.
```bash
dynamite install monitor
```

Start the monitor. The Kibana UI can be found at: http://localhost:5601
```bash
dynamite start monitor
```

#### Agent

##### Specs
```
Linux Kernel: 2.6.32+
4+ GB of RAM at least 2 CPU
```

##### Setup
Prepare the agent, this installs any required kernel-headers needed to install the PF_RING kernel module. 

```bash
dynamite prepare agent
```

Reboot, and install the agent. This process can take between 10 and 40 minutes depending on your specs.

```bash
dynamite install agent --interface en01 --agent-label VLAN-001 --host my-monitor-host-or-ip.local --port 5044
```

Start the agent
```bash
dynamite start agent
```
