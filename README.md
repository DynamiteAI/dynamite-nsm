## Dynamite Network Security Monitor

#### Dynamite-NSM is an network security monitor with an emphasis on *very* fast deployment, minimal configuration, and intuitive management.

Unlike other NSMs Dynamite can be installed without the need of downloading an ISO image. It is offered as standalone commandline utility implemented in pure Python 2/3.

```bash
$ pip install dist/dynamite-nsm-0.0.9.tar.gz
```

### What's in the Box?

#### Agent

##### Agents are scattered throughout your environment, and bind to a network interface (typically a mirrored port), after which traffic is forwarded to the monitor for enrichment and indexing.

#### Monitor

##### Your monitor is responsible for parsing, enriching, indexing, and visualizing analyzed traffic sent from multiple agents.

### Getting Started

While there are quite a few components that are a part of Dynamite-NSM. Standing up a standalone agent/monitor deployment is very simple.

Check to see if your operating system is [supported](SUPPORTED_OSs.md).

#### Monitor (Standalone all components installed)

##### Specs
```
Linux Kernel: 2.6.32+
14 GB of RAM at least 4 CPU
```
##### Setup


Grab the the release, and install through PIP.

```bash
$ pip install dist/dynamite-nsm-0.0.9.tar.gz
```

Install the monitoring components all on the same machine.
```bash
dynamite install monitor
```

Start the monitor. The Kibana UI can be found at: http://localhost:5601
```bash
dynamite start monitor
```

#### Agent

##### Specs
```
Linux Kernel: 2.6.32+
4+ GB of RAM at least 2 CPU
```

##### Setup


Grab the the release, and install through PIP.

```bash
$ pip install dist/dynamite-nsm-0.0.9.tar.gz
```

Prepare the agent, this installs any required kernel-headers needed to install the PF_RING kernel module. 

```bash
dynamite prepare agent
```

Reboot, and install the agent. This process can take between 10 and 40 minutes depending on your specs.

```bash
dynamite install agent --interface en01 --agent-label VLAN-001 --host <my-monitor-host> --port 5044
```

Start the agent
```bash
dynamite start agent
```

If you need to point the agent to a new monitor, this can be accomplished using the below command.

```bash
dynamite point agent --host <my-monitor-host> --port 5044
```
