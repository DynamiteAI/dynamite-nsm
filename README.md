## Dynamite Network Security Monitor

#### [Dynamite NSM](http://dynamite.ai) is an network security monitor with an emphasis on *very* fast deployment, minimal configuration, and intuitive management.

Dynamite NSM can be installed and managed through a standalone commandline utility implemented in pure Python.

No need to download a huge ISO image or install a dedicated operating system! 

**It is compatible with both Python2 and 3, across these [Linux distributions](SUPPORTED_OSs.md).**

#### Install With...

```bash
python setup.py install
```

**...And checkout the** [commandline walkthrough](https://github.com/vlabsio/dynamite-nsm/tree/master/scripts/README.md)


### The Agent

**Agents are scattered throughout your environment, and bind to a network interface (typically a mirrored port), after which traffic is forwarded to the monitor for enrichment and indexing.**

### Getting Started

While there are quite a few components that are a part of Dynamite-NSM. Standing up a standalone agent/monitor deployment is very simple.

Check to see if your operating system is [supported](SUPPORTED_OSs.md).

#### Monitor (Standalone all components installed)

##### Specs
```
Linux Kernel: 2.6.32+
14 GB of RAM at least 4 vCPU
```

##### Installation

Grab the the release, and install.

```bash
python setup.py install
```

Install the monitoring components all on the same machine.
```bash
dynamite install monitor
```

Start the monitor. The Kibana UI can be found at: http://localhost:5601
```bash
dynamite start monitor
```

You can login with the `elastic` user and the password you set during installation.

#### Agent

##### Specs
```
Linux Kernel: 2.6.32+
8+ GB of RAM at least 4 vCPU
```

##### Installation

Grab the the release, and install.

```bash
python setup.py install
```

Prepare the agent, this installs any required kernel-headers needed to install the PF_RING kernel module. 

```bash
dynamite prepare agent
```

Reboot, and install the agent. This process can take between 10 and 40 minutes depending on your specs.

```bash
dynamite install agent --interface mon01 --agent-label honeypot1 --ls-host <logstash-host> --ls-port 5044
```

Start the agent
```bash
dynamite start agent
```

If you need to point the agent to a new monitor, this can be accomplished using the below command.

```bash
dynamite point agent --ls-host <new-logstash-host> --ls-port 5044
```


### Additional Usage

In addition to being able to stand up the monitor as a single instance (ElasticSearch, Logstash, and Kibana all installed) 
This tool can also be used to install these components separately.

Check out the advanced guide [here](https://github.com/vlabsio/dynamite-nsm/tree/master/scripts/README.md).
